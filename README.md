# Latent Regime AI

Probabilistic Latent Regime Discovery for Financial & Behavioral Systems

This repository contains a series of consulting-grade AI models focused on discovering hidden behavioral and financial regimes using probabilistic latent variable models.

Unlike traditional ML projects that optimize for prediction alone, this work emphasizes:

• Structure discovery  
• Uncertainty-aware decisioning  
• Regime stability and drift monitoring  
• Human accountability in AI-influenced decisions  

This repository represents a practical application of probabilistic AI for enterprise decision systems in banking, risk, compliance, and behavioral analytics.

## Philosophy

Modern AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions.  
However, decisions are probabilistic, contextual, and structural — not deterministic predictions.

This project is built on the principle:

> **AI should discover structure. Humans should own decisions.**
