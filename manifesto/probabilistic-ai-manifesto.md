# The Probabilistic AI Manifesto

Modern enterprises increasingly rely on AI systems for operational, financial, and compliance decisions.

Yet real-world decisions are not deterministic outputs.
They are judgments made under uncertainty.

Therefore:

• AI must represent uncertainty, not hide it.
• AI must discover structure, not just optimize loss.
• Humans must remain explicit decision owners.
• Accountability must be designed, not assumed.

This repository is built on the belief that:

> **AI is a structure discovery engine.  
> Humans are decision owners.  
> Governance is a system, not a policy.**

Probabilistic latent models are not academic abstractions —
they are the only mathematically correct foundation for trustworthy enterprise AI.
